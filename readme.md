# Blockchain-Based Book Checkout System

This application is a basic blockchain-based book checkout system, built with Go. It allows you to add books and checkout records to a blockchain, providing immutability and validation for each book checkout transaction.

## Features

- **Blockchain Implementation**: Each book checkout creates a new block, linking back to the previous block.
- **Genesis Block**: The blockchain starts with a genesis block.
- **Add New Books**: Add books with unique identifiers.
- **Retrieve Books**: View all books added to the system.
- **Add Book Checkout**: Add new book checkout transactions as blocks in the blockchain.
- **Retrieve Blockchain**: View the entire blockchain to verify checkout history.

## Dependencies

- Go 1.16 or later
- Gorilla Mux (for HTTP routing)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-checkout-blockchain.git
   cd book-checkout-blockchain
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run this command to install the Gorilla Mux package:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

### 1. View Blockchain

- **Endpoint**: `/blockchain`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieve the entire blockchain to see the history of book checkouts.

   **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/blockchain
   ```

### 2. Add New Book

- **Endpoint**: `/new_book`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Add a new book with details (title, author, publish date, ISBN).

   **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/new_book -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "title": "The Go Programming Language",
       "author": "Alan A. A. Donovan",
       "publish_date": "2015-10-26",
       "isbn": "9780134190440"
   }'
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
       "id": "c5c6ef3a...",
       "title": "The Go Programming Language",
       "author": "Alan A. A. Donovan",
       "publish_date": "2015-10-26",
       "isbn": "9780134190440"
   }
   ```

### 3. View All Books

- **Endpoint**: `/all_books`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieve a list of all books added to the system.

   **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/all_books
   ```

### 4. Add New Book Checkout

- **Endpoint**: `/new_checkout`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Add a new book checkout transaction as a block in the blockchain.

   **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/new_checkout -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "book_id": "c5c6ef3a...",
       "user_id": "user123",
       "checkout_date": "2023-10-28"
   }'
   ```

## Code Structure

- **`main.go`**: Contains the main application logic, blockchain implementation, and HTTP handlers.
- **`Blockchain` Struct**: Manages the blockchain, allowing blocks to be added securely.
- **`Block` Struct**: Defines the structure of each block, including position, data, timestamp, hash, and previous hash.
- **`Book` and `BookCheckout` Structs**: Represent a book entry and a checkout transaction, respectively.

## Running Tests

For production-level applications, you would include tests to verify the blockchain and endpoint functionality. Tests can be added using Goâ€™s testing framework:

1. Create a `main_test.go` file.
2. Use `go test` to run tests.

## Potential Improvements

- Add authentication for book and checkout management.
- Implement persistent storage (e.g., database) for books and blockchain.
- Create a frontend to interact with the application.
